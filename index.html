      <p><span style = "margin-left:3em;">First</span> of all I would like to thank you for unconditionally loving me despite all the hurtful things I've said and done to you. I really appreciate every single time we spend together and I forever will. Thank you for constantly accepting me for who I am. You are one of the best things that's ever happened to me and I will forever cherish you as my other half. I love you so much. Just know that I will always be here for you whenever you need someone to lean on. I will do my best to change my unpleasant sides. I always think that you deserve someone better. That's why I will try to be better on things that I am not really good at such as lendint emotional support and consistent efforts. I know I'm not the most ideal guy someone could ever hope to have but you will never need to worry about me ending up with someone else for my heart will forever be yours. I love you!</p>
